		<h2>Communicating with Me</h2>
		<p>You are welcome to ask me questions by e-mail. I will try to answer
			your e-mails within 12 hours from the time they are received. You
			should make sure to include "CSCI380-01" in the subject line to help me
			get to your e-mail quickly. I will occasionally send e-mail
			announcements to all students in the class and you are responsible for
			all official correspondence sent to your Fisk address
			(@fisk.edu). Make sure that you check this e-mail account regularly. I
			would also prefer receiving e-mails from your Fisk account, rather than
			from commercial e-mail providers such as hotmail, gmail etc. I will
			try to call you by your preferred name. As a matter of
			professionalism, I’d prefer you call me "Prof. Zhang" or "Dr.
			Zhang". I will insist that we all start our e-mails with the
			recipient’s name (not "Hey" or just blank) and end our e-mails with
			the sender's name.

   Note that I will submit the same grade for your CSCI380-10 and CSCI380L-01 courses.
    </p>
   
<p><b>Attendance</b> Attendance in class is strictly required by university policy, unless permitted by the instructor in advance. You are expected to attend all classes and to arrive on time. I will take attendance most days, but not every day.<br>
	<b>Fisk’s Attendance Policy Statement: </b>“Attendance in class is strictly required by University policy. In each course, students who miss more than ten percent of the scheduled class meetings (including labs) due to unexcused absences will be in danger of failing the course. For a class that meets three times per week, the number of unexcused absences would be five class sessions; for a class that meets twice a week, three class sessions; and for a class that meets once per week, two class sessions.”
</p>

    <p><b>Homework Assignments</b> Each assignment will be given a date and a time when the assignment is due. 
	    You are expected to complete all assignments on time, 
	    <b></b>late submissions will receive a zero. Start early and avoid waiting until the last minute!</b>
		Late submissions will only be accepted in exceptional circumstances, such as illness or conference attendance, 
		and must be supported by valid evidence, such as a doctor’s note or conference registration.				
    </p>

<p><b>Labs</b> Each lab will be given a date and a time when the lab is due. 
	You are expected to complete all labs on time, 
	    <b></b>late submissions will receive a zero. Start early and avoid waiting until the last minute!</b>
		Late submissions will only be accepted in exceptional circumstances, such as illness or conference attendance, 
		and must be supported by valid evidence, such as a doctor’s note or conference registration.
</p>
    <p><b>Quizzes</b> There will be several quizzes throughout the semester. Each quiz will be announced in advance. The lowest quiz (when there are three or more quizzes) will be dropped when computing your final grade for the class.
	    Quizzes are closed-book and closed-notes, and no electronic devices are allowed. All personal electronic devices, including calculators, cell phones, watches, and any other electronics, must be stored under your seat during quizzes. Lab computers are also prohibited. Using any electronic device or engaging in cheating will result in a score of zero.

Quizzes must be taken on the scheduled date and time. Missing a quiz will result in a zero unless there are exceptional circumstances, such as illness, conference attendance, or interviews. 
These exceptions must be supported by valid evidence, such as a doctor’s note, conference registration, or an interview invitation that confirms the quiz time is the only available option for both you and the interviewer.
    
    </p>
    
    <p><b>Midterm Exam</b> The midterm exam will be on Wednesday, Mar 5, 2025.

		<p>In determining borderline grades, I reserve the right to consider
			perceived student initiative and class participation.
		</p>

		<p>An incomplete will be given only when a student meets the
			requirements of the latest Fisk University policies. Earning a
			low grade is not a valid reason for an incomplete.
		</p>
		
		<!------------------------------------------------------>
		
		<h2>Make-Up Policy</h2>
		
		
		<p><b>Quizzes and Exams</b> Make-up quizzes/exams will only be given in the event of a
			documented excused absence (for example, medical absences required a
			signed note on letterhead paper from your doctor.) You must notify me
			of an excused absence within 24 hours after the missed quiz/exam or no
			make-up will be allowed. Normally make-up quizzes/exams are somewhat more
			difficult that the original quiz/exam.<br>
      Quizzes/exams can <b>NOT</b> be taken online.
		</p>
				
		
        
        
		
        
				
		<!------------------------------------------------------>
		<h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
		<p>Cheating is not tolerated.  <b>Any student caught cheating will fail the course, regardless of their numerical average in the class at the time</b>. 
			Cheating activities include but are not limited to conferring with one another during a test by text messaging, 
			talking, hand signals, roaming eyes, and other signals.  Do not allow others to look at answers on your paper.  
			Do not bring answers or information sheets into the room that can be seen by another person, i.e. cheat sheet, 
			writing on the arm or other parts of the body, etc. Act responsibly and honestly.  <br>
			All homework submissions must represent the individual student's work, except in those cases where work has explicitly been 
			assigned to teams, 
			in which case the work performed must be that of the team members, with no outside assistance.  
			Solutions to problems may not be used from other sources, including (but not limited to) other students, 
			books, magazines, or the Internet.  Discussions with other students regarding homework is allowed only to 
			the extent of general understanding of the question; however, sharing solutions, solution approaches, or other specific 
			information on homework problems is considered cheating. All homework submissions must represent the individual student's work, 
			except in those cases where work has explicitly been assigned to teams, in which case the work performed must be that of the team members, with no outside assistance. <br>

		<h2>How to Succeed in this Class</h2>
		<p><b>Attend Class</b> Showing up on time for every class is the easiest
			way to improve your grade — not merely because of the credit for
			attendance, but also because of exposure to the content presented in
			class.
		</p>
		
		<p><b>Level of Effort</b> Normally a student can expect to spend about
			two hours of work, outside of class, for each credit unit. Thus a
			typical expected workload would be about six hours per week outside of
			class. This is not a course where students read or write essays. Most
			of your time will be spent experimenting with programs and studying
			programming language conventions and techniques to understand
			concepts.
		</p>
		
		<p><b>Prepare for Class</b> Read the chapter sections ahead of time for
			each class. When reading the material, enter and compile as many of
			the sample programs as possible. You may be surprised at how much this
			reinforces the chapter material. Reading ahead of time will make it
			easier to follow the lecture and it will help you decide what to ask
			about in class.
		</p>
			
		<p><b>Do the Homework</b> Start working on the homework problems as soon
			as possible. Often, a problem that stumps you one day will seem
			obvious a day later. You should view the homework assignments as
			preparation for the exams. It is imperative that you understand and
			complete the homework.
		</p>
				
		<p><b>Manage Your Time</b> I encourage you to develop a system to
			actively manage you priorities and time. You should schedule time each
			week to complete assignments and to complete readings in advance of
			class. Effective time management will help you not only in this class
			but also in the rest of your studies and in your career. Poor time
			management and late completion of assignments will be detrimental to
			your learning experience and will be reflected in your grade for the
			class.
		</p>
		
		<p><b>Stay Organized</b> Organize your class notes and save all of your
			graded homework assignments. These will be a great resource when
			studying for the exams. Also be sure to keep your computer files
			organized. You will write a plethora of programs for this class; it is
			easy or them to quickly become disorganized.
		</p>
		
		<p><b>Visit Me</b> If you have problems during the semester that affect
			your coursework, please see me as soon as possible so we can discuss
			your options for the course. If you find yourself falling behind in
			the class, please see me. It is likely we can work together to get you
			back on track.

		<h2>Course Description</h2>
        <p>
        This course continues the study of data structures and the design and analysis of algorithms. 
		It will include an introduction to algorithm design techniques, including greedy algorithms and divide and conquer.<br>
		This course extends the material from CSCI 120, and provides in-depth analysis and usage of various data structures, including vectors and multidimensional arrays, ADTs (Abstract Data Types), singly- and doubly-linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.  Algorithms to manipulate these data structures are presented and analyzed for complexity.  Other algorithms,
		specifically including searching and sorting, are presented and analyzed for complexity.  Students will develop programs to implement and manipulate these data structures and algorithms.
	</p>
			
        	
		<!------------------------------------------------------>
		<h2>Objectives</h2>
		<p>Upon completion of this course students will be able to:</p>
        <ul style="padding-left:4em">
    		<li>Implement and use various data structures in problem solving, including, but not necessarily limited to Arrays, Lists, both single- and double-linked, Stacks (LIFO), Queues (FIFO), Trees, Graphs, and Hash Tables</li>
    		<li>Implement data structures using programming language such as Java.</li>
    		<li>Apply algorithms applicable to the manipulation of these various data structures, including searching, sorting, tree and graph traversal, and the application of recursion.</li>
    		<li>Analyze algorithms for space and time complexity (Order notation).</li>
		<li>Solve problems for general categories such as greedy algorithms and divide-and-conquer.</li>
		<li>Apply classes of algorithms (P, NP, and NP-Complete).</li>

	</ul>

    </table>

    </p>
   
    <p><b>Attendance</b> Attendance in class is strictly required by university policy, unless permitted by the instructor in advance. You are expected to attend all classes and to arrive on time. I will take attendance most days, but not every day. Your attendance grade is based on those days when I take attendance.</p>
<div style="text-align: center" >
	<p><b>Fisk’s Attendance Policy Statement: </b>“Attendance in class is strictly required by University policy. In each course, students who miss more than ten percent of the scheduled class meetings (including labs) due to unexcused absences will be in danger of failing the course. For a class that meets three times per week, the number of unexcused absences would be five class sessions; for a class that meets twice a week, three class sessions; and for a class that meets once per week, two class sessions.”</p>
</div>
    <p><b>Homework Assignments</b> Each assignment will be given a date and a time when the assignment is due. 
	    You are expected to complete all assignments on time, <b>late submissions will be penalized by 25% (less than 24 hours) and 40% if submitted after 24 hours. Start early, and don’t wait until the last minute!</b> 
	    Your homework must:
    <ul>
        <li>Be ziped as one single archive file if there are more than 1 file</li>
	<li>Have the course number, homework number, your name and student ID in the file name(CSCI100F2F03_Homework1_JohnDoe(0000012345).pdf for example). </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p><b>Quizzes</b> There will be several quizzes throughout the semester. Each quiz will be announced in advanced. The lowest quiz will be dropped when computing your final grade for the class. Quizzes are closed book and closed notes.  No electronic devices may be used. All personal electronic devices must be stored under your seat during the quizzes. This includes calculators, cell phones, watches, and all other electronic devices. Lab computers may not be used on the quizzes.</p>
    
    <p><b>Midterm Exam</b> The midterm exam will be on Thursday, September 29. This will be a closed book and closed notes exam. No electronic devices may be used. All personal electronic devices must be stored under your seat during the exam. This includes calculators, cell phones, watches, and all other electronic devices. Lab computers may not be used on the exam.</p>
    
    <p><b>Final Exam</b> The final exam will be on to-be-updated (<a href="https://www.fisk.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/FINAL-EXAMINATION-SCHEDULE-FALL-2022.pdf">double check here</a>). The final exam will comprehensive and will include all topics covered during the semester. This will be a closed book and closed notes exam. No electronic devices may be used.

     </p>

		<p>In determining borderline grades, I reserve the right to consider
			perceived student initiative and class participation.
		</p>

		<p>An incomplete will be given only when a student meets the
			requirements of the latest Fisk University policies. Earning a
			low grade is not a valid reason for an incomplete.
		</p>
		
		<!------------------------------------------------------>
		
		<h2>Make-Up Policy</h2>
		
		
		<p><b>Quizzes</b> Quizzes cannot be made up. You must be present in class
            on the day of the quiz in order to receive credit for the quiz.
		</p>

		<p><b>Exams</b> Make-up exams will only be given in the event of a
			documented excused absence (for example, medical absences required a
			signed note on letterhead paper from your doctor.) You must notify me
			of an excused absence within 48 hours after the missed exam or no
			make-up will be allowed. Normally make-up exams are somewhat more
			difficult that the original exam.
		</p>
				
		
        
        
		
        
				
		<!------------------------------------------------------>
		<h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
		<p>Cheating is not tolerated.  <b>Any student caught cheating will fail the course, regardless of their numerical average in the class at the time</b>. 
			Cheating activities include but are not limited to conferring with one another during a test by text messaging, 
			talking, hand signals, roaming eyes, and other signals.  Do not allow others to look at answers on your paper.  
			Do not bring answers or information sheets into the room that can be seen by another person, i.e. cheat sheet, 
			writing on the arm or other parts of the body, etc. Act responsibly and honestly.  <br>
			All homework submissions must represent the individual student's work, except in those cases where work has explicitly been 
			assigned to teams, 
			in which case the work performed must be that of the team members, with no outside assistance.  
			Solutions to problems may not be used from other sources, including (but not limited to) other students, 
			books, magazines, or the Internet.  Discussions with other students regarding homework is allowed only to 
			the extent of general understanding of the question; however, sharing solutions, solution approaches, or other specific 
			information on homework problems is considered cheating. All homework submissions must represent the individual student's work, 
			except in those cases where work has explicitly been assigned to teams, in which case the work performed must be that of the team members, with no outside assistance. <br>
			<br>
			Please see the 
			<a href="https://www.fisk.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2019-2020-studenthandbookandacademicplanner.pdf">

        <h2>Student Succes Center</h2>
        <p>
            If you feel you need additional support for this class, you are encouraged to go to 
            the Student Success Center on the first floor of Ambrose Hall or to call 333-6331 for
            information regarding tutoring in this class. The SSC provides free peer tutoring for 
            most 100 and 200 level courses, writing tutorials for papers in all classes, and study 
            strategy advice. The center staff suggests that students seek help early, although 
            drop in and contractual tutorials are arranged throughout the semester.
        </p>

		<!------------------------------------------------------>

		<h2>How to Succeed in this Class</h2>
		<p><b>Attend Class</b> Showing up on time for every class is the easiest
			way to improve your grade — not merely because of the credit for
			attendance, but also because of exposure to the content presented in
			class.
		</p>
		
		<p><b>Level of Effort</b> Normally a student can expect to spend about
			two hours of work, outside of class, for each credit unit. Thus a
			typical expected workload would be about six hours per week outside of
			class. This is not a course where students read or write essays. Most
			of your time will be spent experimenting with programs and studying
			programming language conventions and techniques to understand
			concepts.
		</p>
		
		<p><b>Prepare for Class</b> Read the chapter sections ahead of time for
			each class. When reading the material, enter and compile as many of
			the sample programs as possible. You may be surprised at how much this
			reinforces the chapter material. Reading ahead of time will make it
			easier to follow the lecture and it will help you decide what to ask
			about in class.
		</p>
			
		<p><b>Do the Homework</b> Start working on the homework problems as soon
			as possible. Often, a problem that stumps you one day will seem
			obvious a day later. You should view the homework assignments as
			preparation for the exams. It is imperative that you understand and
			complete the homework.
		</p>
				
		<p><b>Manage Your Time</b> I encourage you to develop a system to
			actively manage you priorities and time. You should schedule time each
			week to complete assignments and to complete readings in advance of
			class. Effective time management will help you not only in this class
			but also in the rest of your studies and in your career. Poor time
			management and late completion of assignments will be detrimental to
			your learning experience and will be reflected in your grade for the
			class.
		</p>
		
		<p><b>Stay Organized</b> Organize your class notes and save all of your
			graded homework assignments. These will be a great resource when
			studying for the exams. Also be sure to keep your computer files
			organized. You will write a plethora of programs for this class; it is
			easy or them to quickly become disorganized.
		</p>
		
		<p><b>Visit Me</b> If you have problems during the semester that affect
			your coursework, please see me as soon as possible so we can discuss
			your options for the course. If you find yourself falling behind in
			the class, please see me. It is likely we can work together to get you
			back on track.
